  text: Hi! Hi there! Hello! Hi! I'm Daisy! I was a dog but I was cursed to be human,
    isn't that wild? I'm trying to learn but this person stuff is hard. English is
    weird, what the heck is a participle? And doing taxes? Until very recently I
    had no measurable income, I'm a dog. A dog with the IRS on her tail. Get it,
    tail? Mine's gone. This is exciting, I'm so happy to meet you!
