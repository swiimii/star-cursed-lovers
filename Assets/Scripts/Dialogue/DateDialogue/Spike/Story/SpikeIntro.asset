  text: 'Hello dearest, it''s a pleasure to meet you. I''m Spike. Yes, that has always
    been my name, it''s okay if you laugh. I wasn''t cursed with spikes until later
    in life, but I won''t change my name because of a curse I have no intention of
    keeping. That''s why I''m here, to find love and break my curse - and hopefully
    to break your curse too.  '
